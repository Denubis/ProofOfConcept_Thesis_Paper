# ProofOfConcept_Thesis_Paper
This is my thesis template paper written in LaTeX as a proof of concept for FOAR705

Purpose

This template is written using the Overleaf implementation of the LaTeX document preparation system. It was designed and tested using the Overleaf online LaTeX editor (https://www.overleaf.com) but has also been tested in other freely available LaTeX editors such as TexMaker and TexStudio. 


Result:
This is a detailed template for writing a masters thesis paper in philosophy. The template is organized with explanatory notes and command syntax and is broken up into organised chapters under the sub-folder called chapters. e.g. introduction.tex, chapter02.tex, chapter03.tex, chapter04.tex, conclusion.tex or appendix.tex. During the writing process I will only need to edit these chapter files, which will consist mainly of plain text. Should I need an additional chapter, for example, chapter 5, I will just need to create a new file (or copy-rename) and old file and then add \chapter{Chapter Five Title} and \input{chapters/chapter05} into the main.tex file.
